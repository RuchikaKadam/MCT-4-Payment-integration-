## JavaScript Fundamentals

The JavaScript code in this project demonstrates the following fundamentals:

1. **DOM Manipulation:** Dynamically update the cart and course details on the webpage based on user interactions.

2. **Event Handling:** Implement event listeners to handle user interactions such as clicking on the "Add to Cart" button and initiating the payment process.

3. **Session Storage:** Store and retrieve cart data using the browser's session storage to maintain the cart state between page reloads.

4. **Razorpay Integration:** Integrate the Razorpay payment gateway for secure and seamless payment processing.

5. **Conditional Logic:** Implement conditional logic to validate cart data and prevent payment initiation if the cart is empty.
